     <string name="longinfocameraintent">A quick way to enable taking pictures or videos in your application without a lot of extra code is to use an Intent to invoke an existing Android camera application. A camera intent makes a request to capture a picture or video clip through an existing camera app and then returns control back to your application. Capturing images using a camera intent is quick way to enable your application to take pictures with minimal coding.</string>

     <string name="cameraapiinfo">Some developers may require a camera user interface that is customized to the look of their application or provides special features. Creating a customized camera activity requires more code than using an intent, but it can provide a more compelling experience for your users. Camera hardware is a shared resource that must be carefully managed so your application does not collide with other applications that may also want to use it. </string>
